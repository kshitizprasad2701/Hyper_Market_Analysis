Order Distribution: Identified trends across slots and delivery areas.
Completion Rates: Analyzed patterns by time slots, drop areas, and product levels.

Delivery Analysis: Explored delivery times by slots, locations, and weekdays/weekends.
📊 Excel Features Applied:

Formulas: Automated metrics like completion rates and LTV.
Pivot Tables: Summarized data trends across multiple dimensions.
Conditional Formatting: Highlighted critical patterns like high ratings for late-night orders.
Macros: Streamlined repetitive data cleaning and transformation tasks.
Charts: Visualized key insights to spot trends and outliers.
💡 Key Insights:

Late-night orders tend to have higher ratings, while morning orders have the least.
Delivery times are shorter on weekends but vary significantly by area.
High discounts correlate with increased order volume in specific slots.
This project honed my skills in data-driven storytelling and solving real-world business problems. Excited to apply these learnings to even more challenging datasets!
